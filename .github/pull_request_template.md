## Blog post?
<!--- If you're doing a guest blog post on our blog:
- if it's all text, and no code, put your post in a `.md` file in
the `_drafts` folder. If you're doing text and code, put it in a
`.Rmd` file and render it as well, so the PR has both `.Rmd`
and `.md` versions of your post.
- See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/roweb/master/_posts/2017-04-11-assertr.md
to copy and paste the yaml header we use - changing to your details
of course. Please include a link for you (e.g., your website or
GitHub profile) in the "url" field.
