70 people from 7 countries on 3 continents, more than 70 ideas leading to 21 projects in 2 days, and one awesome community that just upped its game! We held our [4th annual unconference](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/) in Los Angeles, May 25-26, 2017. We brought together scientists, R-software users and developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profits to get together for a couple of days to hack on projects they dreamed up and to give our online community an opportunity to develop authentic face-to-face relationships.

## Look What We Made!

People proposed and discussed [project ideas in GitHub issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/) in the weeks leading up to the unconf to the point that we had more projects than participants. People sticker-voted for projects they‚Äôd like to work on in order to reduce the number under consideration, and after some brief discussions and self-sorting, teams were working away around the [Cross Campus DTLA](http://www.crosscamp.us/site/locations/cross-campus-downtown-la.html) co-working space for the next day and a half.

Not only did our funders and sponsors - Helmsley Charitable Trust, [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://sloan.org/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/r-server), [Google](http://www.google.com/), [DataCamp](http://datacamp.com/), [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/) - help us make this happen, but people from Microsoft, Google and DataCamp fully participated in unconf projects!

Near the end of Day Two, each group had three minutes with the mic to report on their projects using only their README.md as presentation material. The code for all projects is available at [ropenscilabs](https://github.com/ropenscilabs), our ‚Äúin-development‚Äù home on GitHub. Thanks to [Sean Kross](https://github.com/seankross), you can easily [browse all unconf17 projects](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf17-projects/).

## The Community is one of #rstats Best Assets
As rOpenSci's Community Manager, my favorite aspects of unconf17 were watching connections being made between people, hearing them reflect on their (context-dependent) place in the R community, and being able to step back and support community-focussed discussions and activities initiated by the participants themselves! There are so many community-minded people flying under the radar.

Speaking of awesome community, [R-Ladies](http://rladies.org/), a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community, was incredibly well-represented by both founders of the global organization as well as of local chapters.

I know that unconf17 had an impact on many people, including me, and I'm betting that our vibrant example of walking the talk of being welcoming, creative, respectful and supportive - all while being [wildly productive](#look-what-we-made) - will also have a lasting impact on the R community in general.

Our Project Lead, Karthik Ram, [storified unconf17 tweets](https://storify.com/_inundata/4th-annual-ropensci-unconf) and you can sense the enthusiasm for what happened via the twitter hashtag: [#runconf17](https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23runconf17).
