70 people from 7 countries on 3 continents, 69 ideas leading to 21 projects in 2 days and one awesome community that just upped its game! rOpenSci held its [4th annual unconference](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/) in Los Angeles May 25-26, 2017. We brought together scientists, R-software users and developers, and open data enthusiasts from academia, industry, government, and non-profits to get together for a couple of days to hack on projects they dreamed up and to give our online community an opportunity to develop authentic face-to-face relationships.

## Look what we made!
People proposed and discussed [project ideas in GitHub issues](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf17/issues/) in the weeks leading up to the unconf to the point that we had more projects than participants. People sticker-voted for projects they‚Äôd like to work on in order to reduce the number under consideration and after some brief discussions and self-sorting, teams were working away around the [Cross Campus DTLA](http://www.crosscamp.us/site/locations/cross-campus-downtown-la.html) co-working space.

Near the end of Day Two, groups had three minutes each to report on their projects using only their README.md as presentation material. The code for all projects is available at [ropenscilabs](https://github.com/ropenscilabs), our ‚Äúin-development‚Äù home on GitHub. Thanks to [Sean Kross](https://github.com/seankross), you can easily [browse all unconf17 projects](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf17-projects/).

Not only did our funders and sponsors - Helmsley Charitable Trust, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Microsoft, Google, DataCamp, NumFOCUS - help us make this happen, but people from Microsoft, Google and DataCamp actively participated in unconf projects!
